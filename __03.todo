in ./bin/server_main.js:

make a recursive search through './routes' 
	- require all those modules found, and insert into 'app.use('/', {module})'
	
that way, you do not have to make any updates in the ./bin file 'server_main.js' 
and
you can focus on just getting the correct views:

however, maybe you should also have a function that you could use in your routes:

so that, eg.
	router.get()
	router.post()
	router.
